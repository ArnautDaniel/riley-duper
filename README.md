Iterative melancholy

Riley-Duper 0 is an exercise in the raw brute force to software development.

Riley-Duper 1 brings several speed improvements by unifying the texture base, and expanding the class cohesion.  

What will Riley-Duper 2 bring?

This is an application for sorting images based on related "types" of items in the pictures.  Riley-Duper will output a hidden file that contains the pictures which are linked together.  This can latter be used to generate invoices, and rename the files such that Windows Search finally finds a purpose for something.

An elegant solution to the idea of building a huge software stack to solve the whole problem.  Instead,  we build a simple tool that eliminates the hardest problem (sorting items of related types) and let the rest of the stack we have already become even more efficient.  

Not all of the code is pretty.  I've been forcing myself to write it out in one style, then start from scratch and rebuild it again.  Also interesting is the fact that Factors object system is damn nice.
